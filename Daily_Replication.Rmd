To knit the daily without any code chunks, you can set the parameters in code chunks options. Note that figure captions is a parameter in the code chunk. The full list of code chunk options can be found here: https://yihui.org/knitr/options/

Use `echo=FALSE` when coding to see the outputs in the RMarkdown. Once everything is ready to be knit, change it to `include=FALSE`.

"{mcCancer} cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in Canada. More Canadians die of {mcCancer} cancer than colorectal, pancreatic and breast cancers combined. In {format(Sys.Date(), \"%Y\")} alone, it is estimated that more than 21,000 Canadians are expected to die of {str_to_lower(mcCancer)} cancer. The high rate of death (mortality rate) from {str_to_lower(mcCancer)} cancer reflects both its high rate of diagnosis (incidence rate) and its low survival.

The Canadian Cancer Statistics: A {format(Sys.Date(), \"%Y\")} special report on {mcCancer} cancer, developed by the Canadian Cancer Statistics Advisory Committee in collaboration with the Canadian Cancer Society, Statistics Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, provides new insight into {str_to_lower(mcCancer)} cancer patterns in Canada. The report also provides information on important and emerging issues related to {str_to_lower(mcCancer)} cancer, such as risk factors, screening and treatment. While the results predate the COVIDâ€“19 pandemic, they provide a baseline with which to eventually gauge the impact of the pandemic on rates of {str_to_lower(mcCancer)} cancer incidence, mortality and survival.

# For the last couple of sentences, it is easier to look at the fm_diff table to identify the trend than to automate it. If automation is necessary, have an analyst determine what the best approach for this is.

p3 <- str_glue("While {str_to_lower(mcCancer)} cancer incidence rates are higher among males than females, these rates have been getting closer over time. In 1992, the {str_to_lower(mcCancer)} cancer incidence rate among males ({unitMeasure(uom, irAgeSex92v12$value[3], \"males\")}) was almost over twice that recorded among females ({unitMeasure(uom, irAgeSex92v12$value[4], \"females\")}). However, by 2012 the gap had narrowed considerably ({unitMeasure(uom, irAgeSex92v12$value[5], \"males\")} versus {unitMeasure(uom, irAgeSex92v12$value[6], \"females\")}) due to {case_when(irMale_diff$fm_diff < 0 ~ \"decreasing\", irMale_diff$fm_diff > 0 ~ \"increasing\", TRUE ~ \"constant\")} rates among males and {case_when(irFemale_diff$fm_diff < 0 ~ \"decreasing\", irFemale_diff$fm_diff > 0 ~ \"increasing\", TRUE ~ \"constant\")} rates among females. Rates have subsequently been {rate}, but more quickly among males.
               
The difference in {str_to_lower(mcCancer)} cancer rates in males and females over time largely reflects past differences in tobacco smoking. Among males, a decrease in the prevalence of daily smoking began in the mid-1960s, preceding the decrease in {str_to_lower(mcCancer)} cancer incidence by about 20 years. Among females, the decrease in daily smoking did not start until the 1980s. Trends in {str_to_lower(mcCancer)} cancer mortality rates largely follow trends in {str_to_lower(mcCancer)} cancer incidence.")
